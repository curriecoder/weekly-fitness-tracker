## Description

This project was motivated by wanting to implement newly learned database languages (Mongoose) to create a back end capable of handling an existing front end. This application allows users to keep track of their workout routines and exercises while giving an "at a glance" view of the last 7 days of activity. During this project I learned how to apply Mongoose, Morgan, and general RESTful practices.
